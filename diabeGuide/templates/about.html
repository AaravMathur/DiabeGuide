    <!-- What is Diabetes -->
    <div id="what-is-diabetes">
        <h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
        <p>Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) condition that affects how your body converts food into energy. Normally, when you eat, your body breaks most of your food into glucose (a type of sugar) which enters your bloodstream. Your pancreas then releases insulin — a hormone that helps glucose enter your cells to be used for energy.</p>
        <p>In people with diabetes, this process doesn’t work properly. Either the body doesn’t produce enough insulin, or the cells can’t effectively use the insulin produced. As a result, glucose stays in the bloodstream instead of being absorbed into the cells, leading to high blood sugar (hyperglycemia).</p>
        <p>Over time, uncontrolled diabetes can damage major organs and systems in your body, including the heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves. However, with early detection, healthy lifestyle changes, and proper medical care, diabetes can be effectively managed to live a healthy and active life.</p>
        <p>Common symptoms include excessive thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, extreme fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing wounds, and frequent infections. In early stages, especially with Type 2 diabetes, symptoms can be mild or go unnoticed, which is why regular health check-ups are important.</p>

    <!-- Types of Diabetes -->
    <div id="types-of-diabetes">
        <h2>Types of Diabetes</h2>
        <p>There are several types of diabetes, but the three most common ones are Type 1, Type 2, and Gestational Diabetes. Each type affects insulin production and blood sugar regulation differently.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type 1 Diabetes:</strong> This is an autoimmune condition where the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. It’s usually diagnosed in children or young adults. People with Type 1 diabetes must take insulin daily to survive.</li>
            <li><strong>Type 2 Diabetes:</strong> This is the most common form, where the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn’t make enough. It’s often linked with being overweight, physically inactive, or having a family history of diabetes. It develops slowly and may go unnoticed for years.</li>
            <li><strong>Gestational Diabetes:</strong> Occurs during pregnancy due to hormonal changes that make the body less responsive to insulin. It usually goes away after childbirth but increases the risk of Type 2 diabetes later in life.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other, less common forms include <strong>monogenic diabetes</strong> (caused by a single gene mutation) and <strong>cystic fibrosis-related diabetes</strong>.</p>

    <!-- Why Get Tested -->
    <div id="why-get-tested">
        <h2>Why Get Tested</h2>
        <p>Prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes often develop silently, without any noticeable symptoms. Type 1 diabetes is different — its symptoms can appear suddenly and be severe. That’s why people with any risk factors are strongly advised to get screened, even if they feel healthy.</p>
        <p>Getting tested means having your blood sugar checked, even when you don’t have symptoms. Catching prediabetes early can help prevent or delay the development of Type 2 diabetes. Similarly, detecting Type 2 diabetes early allows people to start treatment and prevent serious complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, or vision loss.</p>
        <p>The testing process is simple and quick. A blood sample is taken at your doctor’s office or clinic, and results are usually available within hours or days. Early detection gives you the best chance to manage or reverse prediabetes through lifestyle changes.</p>

    <!-- When to Get Tested -->
    <div id="when-to-get-tested">
        <h2>When to Get Tested</h2>
        <p><strong>Type 2 Diabetes or Prediabetes:</strong> You should ask your doctor about testing if you have risk factors such as being overweight, physically inactive, having a family history of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or a history of gestational diabetes. If you’ve been tested at a health fair or pharmacy, follow up with your doctor for confirmation.</p>
        <p><strong>Type 1 Diabetes:</strong> If your doctor suspects Type 1 diabetes, your blood may be tested for autoantibodies — substances that indicate your body’s immune system is attacking its own insulin-producing cells. You may also have your urine tested for ketones, which appear when your body burns fat for energy. Ketones in urine typically indicate Type 1 diabetes.</p>
        <p><strong>Gestational Diabetes:</strong> Gestational diabetes typically develops around the 24th week of pregnancy. Most women are tested between 24 and 28 weeks. However, if you’re at higher risk, your doctor may test you earlier. Elevated blood sugar early in pregnancy may suggest pre-existing Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes instead.</p>

    <!-- Types of Tests -->
    <div id="types-of-tests">
        <h2>Types of Diabetes Tests</h2>

        <h3>A1C Test</h3>
        <p>The A1C test measures your average blood sugar level over the past 2–3 months. It doesn’t require fasting.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Normal: Below 5.7%</li>
            <li>Prediabetes: 5.7%–6.4%</li>
            <li>Diabetes: 6.5% or higher</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fasting Blood Sugar Test</h3>
        <p>This test measures your blood sugar after fasting (no food) for at least 8 hours.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Normal: 99 mg/dL or below</li>
            <li>Prediabetes: 100–125 mg/dL</li>
            <li>Diabetes: 126 mg/dL or higher</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Glucose Tolerance Test</h3>
        <p>This test measures your blood sugar before and after you drink a sweet liquid containing glucose. Blood sugar is tested several times after drinking.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Normal (after 2 hours): 140 mg/dL or below</li>
            <li>Prediabetes: 140–199 mg/dL</li>
            <li>Diabetes: 200 mg/dL or higher</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Random Blood Sugar Test</h3>
        <p>This test can be done at any time, regardless of when you last ate.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Diabetes: 200 mg/dL or above (along with symptoms)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tests for Gestational Diabetes</h3>
        <p><strong>Glucose Screening Test:</strong> You drink a sweet liquid, and after 1 hour, your blood sugar is tested. A result of 140 mg/dL or lower is normal. Higher results require further testing.</p>
        <p><strong>Glucose Tolerance Test:</strong> Similar to the test above but more detailed. It involves fasting and multiple blood sugar checks over 2–3 hours. The results vary depending on the glucose drink size and test protocol. Your doctor will explain your results and what they mean.</p>
